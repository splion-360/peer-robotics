        (1)The loss of regression of boxes.
          GIOU loss is defined in  https://arxiv.org/abs/1902.09630.

        Note: The loss factor is 2-w*h/(img_size**2), which is used to influence the
             balance of the loss value at different scales.
        (2)The loss of confidence.
            Includes confidence loss values for foreground and background.

        Note: The backgroud loss is calculated when the maximum iou of the box predicted
              by the feature point and all GTs is less than the threshold.
        (3)The loss of classesã€‚
            The category loss is BCE, which is the binary value of each class.

        :return: The average loss(loss_giou, loss_conf, loss_cls) of all batches of this detection layer.

        NOTE: label_mix represent the weight/coefficient used for the mixup data augmentation, where two images (and their labels) are linearly combined to produce a new image. Thus the corresponding losses should be multiplied by this weighing factor during backpropogation.
